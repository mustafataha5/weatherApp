## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher
- **MongoDB**: Local instance or cloud-based (e.g., [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- **OpenWeather API Key**: Sign up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) to obtain a free API key
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafataha5/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory using `.env.example` as a template. Example content:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
PORT=5000
```
> **Security Note**: Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent exposing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
> **Tip**: Use `nodemon server.js` for automatic server restarts during development.

The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Start the React application:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## üìñ Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Enter a city name in the search bar to fetch current weather data.
3. Save favorite locations to MongoDB for quick access.
4. Manage saved locations (view or delete) through the intuitive interface.
